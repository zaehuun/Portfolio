            <p class="why_txt"> I first encountered EDM genre when I was 12 years old. I started to like EDM because of its rhythmical feel. Since then, I have searched and listened to songs by many DJs such as Avicii, David Guetta, Steve Aoki, Hardwell, etc. After I became an adult to see them, I participated in various edm festivals, and I became more interested because I was attracted to the atmosphere of excitement and freedom.</p>

When I was a soldier, when I heard that he was coming to Korea, I paid a lot of money to go to see a performance. It is his style of music that is trendy and has melodies. Recently, I fell in love with this style and he became my favorite DJ.</p>
